# discord-js-factsphere

This code is for a Discord bot written in Node.js. It takes a file with Fact Sphere quotes on each line, and each time a user asks for a "fact" by typing !fact, it gets a random line from the file and prints it to the user. 

Note that the bot needs a token to run. This comes from the "General Information" section in the page at the Discord developer portal where you adjust the settings for your bot. See [this page](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) for more details on how to set up your bot.

This bot was written for a demo for a talk I will be giving at The JavaScript Club in Cleveland.
